## Short description of the project:
This project is designed specifically for salespeople and sales companies. The idea is to create an interface where employees and employers can find each other in an interactive way and not through a traditional search. The basic operation of the interface is as follows: the system compares the employee's personality with the expectations of the positions, assigns a match level to each position and in case the employee reaches the minimum level the position set as acceptable, the system offers to establish a relationship between the company and the employee.
